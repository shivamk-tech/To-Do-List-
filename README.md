# ✅ Terminal-Based To-Do List (JavaScript)

This is a **simple terminal/browser-prompt based To-Do List application** built using **vanilla JavaScript**.  
It allows users to **add tasks, view tasks, delete tasks, and mark tasks as completed** using a menu-driven system.

This project is specially made for **beginners** to understand:
- Arrays
- Objects
- Loops
- Functions
- Conditionals
- Basic program flow

## 🚀 Features

- ➕ Add a new task  
- 📋 View all tasks  
- ❌ Delete a task by ID  
- ✅ Mark a task as completed  
- 🔁 Runs continuously until user exits  

---

## 🧠 How It Works

- All tasks are stored inside an array called `LIST`
- Each task is stored as an object in this format:

```js
{
  id: 1,
  task: "Your task here",
  status: false
}
